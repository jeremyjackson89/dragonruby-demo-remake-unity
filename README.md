# Space Shooter Demo

## About
This game is a remake of a [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk) tech demo that I've made with [Unity](https://unity.com/) as a favor to [Amir Rajan](https://github.com/amirrajan). The purpose of this remake was to compare how much code was needed to produce the game in Unity vs DragonRuby. Comparison gifs provided below.
